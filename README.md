CamelCase_to_underscore!
=======================

This tool will help you convert files that use CamelCase conventions to \_underscoring!

Running the program is simple:

`$ cd <wherever this may live>/CamelCase_to_underscore
 $ python main.py`

If you want to convert a single phrase (or a number of phrases for that matter),\n
run the program as is and it will prompt you for a phrase to convert.

If you have a file (or many files!) to convert, place them in the _'to be converted'_\n
directory and then run the program.  It will detect the files that are there, and then\n
read them, convert them, and place the converted file in the _'converted'_ directory!
