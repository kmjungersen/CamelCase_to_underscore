#CamelCase_to_underscore!


This tool will help you convert files that use CamelCase conventions to \_underscoring!

Running the program is simple:

`$ cd <wherever>/<this>/<may>/<live>/CamelCase_to_underscore`

`$ python main.py`

If you want to convert a single phrase (or a number of phrases for that matter), run the program as is and it will prompt you for a phrase to convert.

If you have a file (or many files!) to convert, place them in the _'to be converted'_
directory and then run the program.  It will detect the files that are there and then
read them, convert them, and place the converted file in the _'converted'_ directory!

**IMPORTANT NOTE:** MAKE SURE TO **COPY** YOUR FILES to the *'to_be_converted'* directory, because after running this program,
**IT WILL DELETE THEM!**  Ye have been warned!
